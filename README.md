# SuperCiv
A base ruleset mod that buffs *everything* in vanilla Unciv, brings in some new additions to the mix, and everything in between. 
It is currently incomplete, however.

### Mod Compatibility
- As this is a base ruleset mod, mods like RekMOD are incompatible and cannot be used altogether.
- Theoretically, SuperCiv should be compatible with all extension and audiovisual\* mods.
<br>(\* Mods that only have audio and/or graphics, like tileset mods.)

## Overview
SuperCiv is a base ruleset mod that changes *everything* in the current ruleset of Unciv, ranging from small unit buffs, to massive 
enhancements to civilizations and their unique units, buildings, and improvements. An example is The Maya, which received a buff to 
their unique ability, "The Long Count", that gives all cities a set amount of Science that increases as The Maya reaches a new era.<br>

SuperCiv not only buffs everything in current vanilla Unciv, but also adds in new content. These include new unit promotions, specialists, 
units, etc. Examples include the City Raider promotions and India's new unique unit: Gandhi's Wrath. You'll have to see it for yourself about 
what unit the latter replaces though. ;)
