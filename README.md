## Overview
SuperCiv is a base ruleset mod that changes *everything* in the current ruleset of Unciv, ranging from small unit buffs, to massive 
enhancements to civilizations and their unique units, buildings, and improvements. An example is The Maya, which received buffs to 
their unique ability, "The Long Count", that gives all cities a set amount of Science that increases as The Maya reaches a new era, 
as well as gaining free Observatories to all cities.<br>

SuperCiv not only buffs everything in current vanilla Unciv, but also adds in new content. These include new unit promotions, specialists, 
units, etc. Examples include the City Raider promotions and India's new unique unit: Gandhi's Wrath. You'll have to see it for yourself about 
what unit the latter replaces though. ;)<br>

Starting with Beta v0.3, SuperCiv delivers additional support to certain mods listed [here](#mods-with-additional-content), which can range 
from Palace replacements to new units and buildings. As extension mods often overwrite anything on the base ruleset, SuperCiv is unfortunately 
limited to the aforementioned forms of additional content when specific mods are loaded.<br>
